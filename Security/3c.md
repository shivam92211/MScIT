# Lab: Explore DNS Traffic

## Objectives
- **Part 1**: Capture DNS Traffic
- **Part 2**: Explore DNS Query Traffic
- **Part 3**: Explore DNS Response Traffic

## Background / Scenario
Wireshark is an open-source packet capture and analysis tool that provides a detailed breakdown of network protocols. It is widely used for troubleshooting, security analysis, and protocol exploration. In this lab, you will use Wireshark to capture and analyze DNS traffic, focusing on both query and response packets.

### Required Resources
- A Windows PC with internet access
- Wireshark installed

**Note**: Using Wireshark may violate network policies in some environments. Ensure you have permission before proceeding.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Capture DNS Traffic

1. **Open Wireshark**:
   - Launch Wireshark and start capturing traffic by double-clicking the active network interface.

2. **Clear the DNS Cache**:
   - Open a Command Prompt and run the following command to clear the DNS cache:
     ```cmd
     ipconfig /flushdns
     ```

3. **Enter nslookup Interactive Mode**:
   - In the Command Prompt, type `nslookup` to enter interactive mode:
     ```cmd
     nslookup
     ```

4. **Query a Domain**:
   - Enter the domain name of a website (e.g., `www.cisco.com`) at the `>` prompt:
     ```
     > www.cisco.com
     ```

5. **Exit nslookup**:
   - Type `exit` to leave the nslookup interactive mode and close the Command Prompt.

6. **Stop the Wireshark Capture**:
   - Click the **Stop** button in Wireshark to halt the packet capture.

### Part 2: Explore DNS Query Traffic

1. **Filter for DNS Traffic**:
   - In Wireshark, apply the filter `udp.port == 53` to display only DNS packets.

2. **Analyze the DNS Query Packet**:
   - Locate the packet labeled **Standard query 0x0002 A www.cisco.com**.
   - Expand the packet details in the **Packet Details** pane to view:
     - **Ethernet II**: Source and destination MAC addresses.
     - **IPv4**: Source and destination IP addresses.
     - **UDP**: Source and destination ports (default DNS port is 53).
     - **DNS Query**: Flags and queries.

3. **Compare with System Information**:
   - Open a Command Prompt and run the following commands to gather system information:
     ```cmd
     arp -a
     ipconfig /all
     ```
   - Compare the MAC and IP addresses from these commands with those in the Wireshark capture.

4. **Examine DNS Query Flags**:
   - Expand the **Domain Name System (query)** section to observe the recursive query flag.

### Part 3: Explore DNS Response Traffic

1. **Analyze the DNS Response Packet**:
   - Locate the corresponding **Standard query response 0x0002 A www.cisco.com** packet.
   - Compare the source and destination MAC, IP, and port numbers with those in the query packet.

2. **Examine DNS Response Details**:
   - Expand the **Domain Name System (response)** section to view:
     - **Flags**: Indicates if the DNS server supports recursive queries.
     - **Queries and Answers**: Includes CNAME and A records.

3. **Compare with nslookup Results**:
   - Verify that the DNS response details in Wireshark match the results obtained earlier using `nslookup`.

## Reflection Questions

1. **What else can you learn about the network when you remove the filter?**
   - Without the `udp.port == 53` filter, Wireshark displays other types of traffic, such as ARP and DHCP. This additional data can reveal information about devices and their roles within the local network.

2. **How can an attacker use Wireshark to compromise network security?**
   - An attacker on the same LAN can use Wireshark to capture unencrypted traffic, potentially extracting sensitive information like passwords or session tokens.
