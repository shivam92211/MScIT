# Lab: Examining Telnet and SSH in Wireshark

## Objectives
- **Part 1**: Examine a Telnet session with Wireshark.
- **Part 2**: Examine an SSH session with Wireshark.

## Background / Scenario
In this lab, you will configure a router to accept SSH connectivity and use Wireshark to capture and view Telnet and SSH sessions. This will demonstrate the importance of encryption with SSH.

### Required Resources
- CyberOps Workstation VM

## Part 1: Examining a Telnet Session with Wireshark

### Step 1: Capture data
1. **Start the CyberOps Workstation VM**:
   - Log in with the username `analyst` and password `cyberops`.

2. **Open a terminal window** and start Wireshark:
   ```bash
   sudo wireshark-gtk
   ```
   - When prompted, enter the password: `cyberops`.

3. **Start a Wireshark capture** on the `lo` (Loopback) interface:
   - In Wireshark, select the `lo` interface and click "Start".

4. **Open another terminal window** and start a Telnet session to the localhost:
   ```bash
   telnet localhost
   ```
   - When prompted, enter the username `analyst` and password `cyberops`.
   - Note: It may take several minutes for the connection prompt to appear.

5. **Stop the Wireshark capture** after you have provided the user credentials.

### Step 2: Examine the Telnet session
1. **Apply a filter** in Wireshark to display only Telnet-related traffic:
   - Enter `telnet` in the filter field and click "Apply".

2. **Right-click one of the Telnet lines** in the Packet list section of Wireshark, and from the drop-down list, select "Follow TCP Stream".

3. **Examine the Follow TCP Stream window**:
   - The entire Telnet session is displayed in plaintext, including your password.
   - Notice that the username appears with duplicate characters due to the echo setting in Telnet.

4. **Close the Follow TCP Stream window** after reviewing the session.

5. **Exit the Telnet session** by typing:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```

## Part 2: Examine an SSH Session with Wireshark

### Step 1: Capture data
1. **Start another Wireshark capture** on the `lo` interface.

2. **Establish an SSH session** with the localhost:
   ```bash
   ssh localhost
   ```
   - When prompted, type `yes` to continue connecting.
   - Enter the password: `cyberops`.

3. **Stop the Wireshark capture** after logging in.

### Step 2: Examine the SSH session
1. **Apply an SSH filter** in Wireshark:
   - Enter `ssh` in the filter field and click "Apply".

2. **Right-click one of the SSHv2 lines** in the Packet list section of Wireshark, and in the drop-down list, select "Follow TCP Stream".

3. **Examine the Follow TCP Stream window**:
   - The data has been encrypted and is unreadable.
   - Compare this to the plaintext data from the Telnet session.

4. **Close the Follow TCP Stream window** after reviewing the session.

5. **Close Wireshark**.

## Reflection
Why is SSH preferred over Telnet for remote connections?

- **Answer**: SSH encrypts all communications, preventing sensitive information like usernames and passwords from being intercepted during transmission. Telnet, on the other hand, transmits data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
