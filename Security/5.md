### Lab: Attacking a MySQL Database

---

#### **Objective**
The objective of this lab is to analyze a SQL injection attack using a pre-captured PCAP file. By examining the network traffic, you will understand how attackers exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to interact with and manipulate databases. You will also learn how to identify malicious queries and extract sensitive information from the database.

---

#### **Background**
SQL injection is a common web application vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious SQL queries into input fields or URLs. These queries can bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, modify database content, or even execute administrative operations on the database server.

In this lab, you will use Wireshark, a network packet analyzer, to explore a PCAP file containing a SQL injection attack against a MySQL database. The goal is to follow the attacker's steps, understand the queries used, and answer questions about the attack.

---

#### **Required Resources**
1. **CyberOps Workstation Virtual Machine** (or any Linux-based VM with Wireshark installed).
2. Internet access.
3. Pre-captured PCAP file (`SQL_Lab.pcap`).

---

### **Instructions**

---

### **Part 1: Open the PCAP File and Follow the SQL Injection Attack**

#### **Step 1: Open Wireshark and Load the PCAP File**
1. Start the **CyberOps Workstation VM**.
2. Open **Wireshark**:
   - Click on **Applications > CyberOPS > Wireshark**.
3. In Wireshark, click **Open** in the middle of the application window.
4. Navigate to the directory `/home/analyst/lab.support.files` and open the file `SQL_Lab.pcap`.

   **Question:** What are the two IP addresses involved in this SQL injection attack?  
   **Answer:** `10.0.2.4` (attacker) and `10.0.2.15` (target).

### **Part 2: Analyze the SQL Injection Attack**

#### **Step 2: View the Initial SQL Injection Attempt**
1. In Wireshark, locate **line 13** of the capture and right-click it. Select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
2. Observe the conversation between the attacker and the target:
   - The source (attacker) sends a GET request to the target (`10.0.2.15`).
   - The target responds with data from the database.

3. Use the **Find** feature in the HTTP Stream window to search for the string `1=1`.

   **Explanation:** The query `1=1` is always true. This allows the attacker to test if the application is vulnerable to SQL injection. If the database responds with a record instead of an error, the application is vulnerable.

4. Close the **HTTP Stream** window and click **Clear** to return to the full capture.

---

#### **Step 3: Continue Analyzing the Attack**
1. Locate **line 19** in the capture and right-click it. Select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
2. Search for the string `1' or 1=1 union select database(), user()#`.

   **Explanation:** This query retrieves the database name (`dvwa`) and the database user (`dvwa@localhost`). It also displays multiple user accounts stored in the database.

3. Close the **HTTP Stream** window and click **Clear**.

---

#### **Step 4: Extract System Information**
1. Locate **line 22** in the capture and right-click it. Select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
2. Search for the string `1' or 1=1 union select null, version()#`.

   **Question:** What is the version of the MySQL database?  
   **Answer:** `MySQL 5.7.12-0`.

3. Close the **HTTP Stream** window and click **Clear**.

---

#### **Step 5: Retrieve Table Information**
1. Locate **line 25** in the capture and right-click it. Select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
2. Search for the string `1' or 1=1 union select null, table_name from information_schema.tables#`.

   **Explanation:** This query retrieves all tables in the database. The output includes many tables because the attacker specified `null` without further filtering.

   **Question:** What would the modified command `(1' OR 1=1 UNION SELECT null, column_name FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.columns WHERE table_name='users')` do?  
   **Answer:** It would filter the output to display only columns related to the `users` table, providing a shorter and more specific result.

3. Close the **HTTP Stream** window and click **Clear**.

---

#### **Step 6: Extract Password Hashes**
1. Locate **line 28** in the capture and right-click it. Select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
2. Search for the string `1' or 1=1 union select user, password from users#`.

   **Explanation:** This query retrieves usernames and password hashes from the `users` table.

   **Question:** Which user has the password hash `8d3533d75ae2c3966d7e0d4fcc69216b`?  
   **Answer:** `1337`.

3. Use a password-cracking tool like [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) to crack the hash.

   **Question:** What is the plain-text password?  
   **Answer:** `charley`.

4. Close the **HTTP Stream** window and any remaining windows.

### **Reflection**

#### **Questions**
1. **What is the risk of having platforms use the SQL language?**  
   **Answer:** SQL is widely used in web applications to interact with databases. If not properly secured, it can be exploited through SQL injection attacks, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, and system compromise.

2. **What are two methods to prevent SQL injection attacks?**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Filter user input:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they do not contain malicious code.  
   - **Use parameterized queries:** Implement prepared statements with placeholders for user input to prevent direct execution of injected SQL code.

---

### **Conclusion**
In this lab, you analyzed a SQL injection attack by examining network traffic captured in a PCAP file. You followed the attacker's steps, identified malicious queries, and extracted sensitive information such as database names, table structures, and password hashes. Understanding these techniques is crucial for securing web applications and preventing SQL injection vulnerabilities.

### **Additional Notes**
- Always use tools like Wireshark responsibly and only on authorized systems.
- Practice secure coding practices to mitigate SQL injection risks in your own applications.
- Regularly update and patch software to address known vulnerabilities.
