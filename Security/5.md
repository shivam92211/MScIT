### Steps to Perform the Practical:

#### **1. Install Required Packages:**
   - Open the terminal and update your package list:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     ```
   - Install Wireshark (if not already installed):
     ```bash
     sudo apt install wireshark
     ```
   - During installation, you may be prompted to allow non-superusers to capture packets. Select **Yes** to proceed.

---

#### **2. Open Wireshark and Load the PCAP File:**
   - Launch Wireshark from the terminal:
     ```bash
     wireshark
     ```
   - In the Wireshark application, click **File > Open**.
   - Browse to the directory containing the `SQL_Lab.pcap` file (e.g., `/home/analyst/lab.support.files/`).
   - Select the `SQL_Lab.pcap` file and click **Open**.

---

#### **3. Identify the IP Addresses Involved:**
   - Observe the captured network traffic in Wireshark.
   - Identify the two IP addresses involved in the SQL injection attack (e.g., `10.0.2.4` and `10.0.2.15`).

---

#### **4. View the SQL Injection Attack:**
   - In the Wireshark capture, locate line 13 (a GET HTTP request).
   - Right-click on line 13 and select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
   - In the HTTP stream window, click **Find** and search for `1=1`.
   - Observe how the attacker tests for SQL injection vulnerability by entering `1=1`.

---

#### **5. Analyze the SQL Injection Attack Continuation:**
   - In the Wireshark capture, locate line 19.
   - Right-click on line 19 and select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
   - Search for `1=1` again to see the attacker's query:
     ```
     1' or 1=1 union select database(), user()#
     ```
   - Note the database name (`dvwa`) and the database user (`dvwa@localhost`).

---

#### **6. Extract System Information:**
   - In the Wireshark capture, locate line 22.
   - Right-click on line 22 and select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
   - Search for `1=1` to find the attacker's query:
     ```
     1' or 1=1 union select null, version()#
     ```
   - Identify the MySQL version (e.g., `MySQL 5.7.12-0`).

---

#### **7. Retrieve Table Information:**
   - In the Wireshark capture, locate line 25.
   - Right-click on line 25 and select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
   - Search for `users` to see the attacker's query:
     ```
     1' or 1=1 union select null, table_name from information_schema.tables#
     ```
   - Observe the list of tables in the database.

---

#### **8. Extract Password Hashes:**
   - In the Wireshark capture, locate line 28.
   - Right-click on line 28 and select **Follow > HTTP Stream**.
   - Search for `1=1` to find the attacker's query:
     ```
     1' or 1=1 union select user, password from users#
     ```
   - Note the usernames and password hashes.
   - Use a website like [CrackStation](https://crackstation.net/) to crack the password hash (e.g., `8d3533d75ae2c3966d7e0d4fcc69216b` corresponds to the plain-text password `charley`).

---

#### **9. Reflection:**
   - Consider the risks of SQL injection attacks and research methods to prevent them, such as:
     - Filtering user input.
     - Using parameterized queries or stored procedures.

---

### Notes:
- Ensure you have the `SQL_Lab.pcap` file in the specified directory (`/home/analyst/lab.support.files/`). If not, download or obtain the file before starting.
- If you encounter permission issues while running Wireshark, add your user to the `wireshark` group:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
  ```
  Log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
