# Practical Guide: Hashing Files Using OpenSSL

This guide will walk you through the steps to install the required tools, create a file, and generate its SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash values using OpenSSL. You will also learn how to verify the integrity of the file by comparing hash values after making changes.

---

## Prerequisites
1. A Linux-based operating system (SecurityOps).
2. Basic knowledge of terminal commands.

---

## Step 1: Install Required Tools
1. Update your system's package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install OpenSSL (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openssl
   ```
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   openssl version
   ```

---

## Step 2: Create a Custom Text File
1. Open your terminal.
2. Create a custom text file named `letter_to_grandma.txt`:
   ```bash
   nano letter_to_grandma.txt
   ```
   - Add the following content to the file:
     ```
     Hi Grandma,
     I am writing this letter to thank you for the chocolate chip cookies you sent me. I got them this morning and I have already eaten half of the box! They are absolutely delicious!

     I wish you all the best. Love,
     Your cookie-eater grandchild.
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl + O`, then `Ctrl + X`).

---

## Step 3: Generate SHA-256 and SHA-512 Hashes
1. Generate the SHA-256 hash of `letter_to_grandma.txt`:
   ```bash
   openssl sha256 letter_to_grandma.txt
   ```
   - Copy the hash value for future reference.

2. Generate the SHA-512 hash of `letter_to_grandma.txt`:
   ```bash
   openssl sha512 letter_to_grandma.txt
   ```
   - Copy the hash value for future reference.

---

## Step 4: Modify the File and Recalculate Hashes
1. Open the `letter_to_grandma.txt` file and make a small change (e.g., add or remove a word):
   ```bash
   nano letter_to_grandma.txt
   ```
   - For example, change "delicious" to "amazing".
   - Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl + O`, then `Ctrl + X`).

2. View the updated content of the file:
   ```bash
   cat letter_to_grandma.txt
   ```

3. Recalculate the SHA-256 hash of the modified file:
   ```bash
   openssl sha256 letter_to_grandma.txt
   ```
   - Compare this hash with the original SHA-256 hash. They should be different.

4. Recalculate the SHA-512 hash of the modified file:
   ```bash
   openssl sha512 letter_to_grandma.txt
   ```
   - Compare this hash with the original SHA-512 hash. They should be different.

---

## Expected Results
- The SHA-256 and SHA-512 hash values of the file will change after modifying its content.
- This demonstrates how hashing can be used to verify the integrity of a file.

---

## Notes
- Hashing is a one-way process. You cannot retrieve the original content from the hash value.
- This practical is for educational purposes only. Do not use these tools for malicious purposes.
