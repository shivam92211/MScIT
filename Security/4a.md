# Lab: Using Wireshark to Examine HTTP and HTTPS Traffic

## Objectives
- **Part 1**: Capture and view HTTP traffic.
- **Part 2**: Capture and view HTTPS traffic.

## Background / Scenario
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol used to present data via a web browser. However, HTTP does not safeguard exchanged data. HTTPS, on the other hand, uses encryption via certificates to protect data in transit. While HTTPS provides encryption, it does not inherently mean a site is trustworthy. Threat actors often use HTTPS to mask malicious activities.

In this lab, you will capture and analyze HTTP and HTTPS traffic using `tcpdump` and Wireshark.

### Required Resources
- CyberOps Workstation virtual machine
- Internet access

## Part 1: Capture and View HTTP Traffic

### Step 1: Start the Virtual Machine and Log In
1. **Start the CyberOps Workstation VM**:
   - Username: `analyst`
   - Password: `cyberops`

2. **Open a Terminal**:
   - Launch a terminal application.

3. **Identify Network Interfaces**:
   - Run the following command to list network interfaces and their IP addresses:
     ```bash
     ip address
     ```
   - Note the interface name (e.g., `enp0s3`) and its IP address.

4. **Start tcpdump**:
   - Use the following command to start capturing HTTP traffic:
     ```bash
     sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -s 0 -w httpdump.pcap
     ```
   - Enter the password: `cyberops`.

   **Explanation**:
   - `-i enp0s3`: Specifies the network interface to capture traffic.
   - `-s 0`: Captures the full packet length.
   - `-w httpdump.pcap`: Writes the captured traffic to a `.pcap` file.

5. **Generate HTTP Traffic**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to:
     ```
     http://www.altoromutual.com/login.jsp
     ```
   - Enter the following credentials:
     - Username: `Admin`
     - Password: `Admin`
   - Click **Login**.

6. **Stop tcpdump**:
   - Return to the terminal and press **Ctrl+C** to stop the capture.

### Step 2: Analyze the HTTP Capture
1. **Open the Capture File in Wireshark**:
   - Navigate to the home directory of the `analyst` user.
   - Double-click the `httpdump.pcap` file to open it in Wireshark.

2. **Filter for HTTP Traffic**:
   - In Wireshark, apply the filter:
     ```
     http
     ```

3. **Examine the POST Request**:
   - Locate the **POST** request in the packet list.
   - Expand the **HTML Form URL Encoded** section in the lower pane.

   **Questions**:
   - What two pieces of information are displayed in the POST request?
     ```plaintext
     uid: Admin
     passw: Admin
     ```

4. **Close Wireshark**.

## Part 2: Capture and View HTTPS Traffic

### Step 1: Start tcpdump
1. **Capture HTTPS Traffic**:
   - In the terminal, run the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -s 0 -w httpsdump.pcap
     ```
   - Enter the password: `cyberops`.

2. **Generate HTTPS Traffic**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to:
     ```
     https://www.netacad.com
     ```
   - If prompted with a "Secure Connection Failed" error, update the system date and time:
     ```bash
     sudo date -s "DD MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS"
     ```
     Replace `DD MMM YYYY HH:MM:SS` with the current date and time.

   - Log in with your NetAcad credentials.

3. **Stop tcpdump**:
   - Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal to stop the capture.

### Step 2: Analyze the HTTPS Capture
1. **Open the Capture File in Wireshark**:
   - Navigate to the home directory of the `analyst` user.
   - Double-click the `httpsdump.pcap` file to open it in Wireshark.

2. **Filter for HTTPS Traffic**:
   - Apply the filter:
     ```
     tcp.port == 443
     ```

3. **Examine the HTTPS Messages**:
   - Locate an **Application Data** message.
   - Expand the **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS)** section in the lower pane.

   **Questions**:
   - What has replaced the HTTP section in the HTTPS capture?
     ```plaintext
     Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS 1.2)
     ```
   - Is the application data in plaintext or encrypted?
     ```plaintext
     Encrypted using TLSv1.2
     ```

4. **Close Wireshark**.

## Reflection Questions

1. **What are the advantages of using HTTPS instead of HTTP?**
   ```plaintext
   HTTPS encrypts the data payload, ensuring that only devices part of the encrypted conversation can view the data.
   ```

2. **Are all websites that use HTTPS considered trustworthy?**
   ```plaintext
   No. Malicious websites can use HTTPS to appear legitimate while still capturing user data and logins.
   ```
