## Part 1: Use Kibana to Learn About a Malware Exploit

### Step 1: Narrow the timeframe
1. **Log in to Security Onion**:
   - Username: `analyst`
   - Password: `cyberops`

2. **Open Kibana**:
   - Log in with username `analyst` and password `cyberops`.
   - Set an **Absolute time range** to narrow the focus to January 2017.

3. **Zoom into the event**:
   - In the **Total Log Count Over Time** visualization, click and drag to zoom in on the data point representing the attack. Repeat until you see detailed information.

### Step 2: Locate the Event in Kibana
1. **Navigate to the NIDS Alert Data dashboard**:
   - Click **NIDS** under the navigation menu.

2. **Zoom further into the event**:
   - In the **NIDS – Alerts Over Time** visualization, click and drag to select the graph plot line corresponding to the attack.

3. **Filter the first event**:
   - Click the first point on the timeline to filter for only that event.

4. **Examine the alert details**:
   - Scroll to the **NIDS Alerts** section and expand the first event.

   **Questions**:
   - What is the time of the first detected NIDS alert in Kibana?
     ```plaintext
     Jan 27, 2017 – 22:54:43
     ```
   - What is the source IP address in the alert?
     ```plaintext
     172.16.4.193
     ```
   - What is the destination IP address in the alert?
     ```plaintext
     194.87.234.129
     ```
   - What is the destination port in the alert? What service is this?
     ```plaintext
     80, HTTP
     ```
   - What is the classification of the alert?
     ```plaintext
     Trojan Activity
     ```
   - What is the destination geo country name?
     ```plaintext
     Russia
     ```

5. **Research the malware family**:
   - Visit the link in the `signature_info` field of the alert to view the Emerging Threats Snort rule.

   **Questions**:
   - What is the malware family for this event?
     ```plaintext
     Exploit_Kit_RIG
     ```
   - What is the severity of the exploit?
     ```plaintext
     Major
     ```

### Step 3: View the Transcript (CapME!)
1. **Pivot to CapME!**:
   - Click the `_id` value of the alert to open the transcript in CapME!.

2. **Examine the transcript**:
   - Look at the first block of blue text (source request).

   **Questions**:
   - What website did the user intend to connect to?
     ```plaintext
     www.homeimprovement.com
     ```
   - What URL did the browser refer the user to?
     ```plaintext
     ty.benme.com
     ```
   - What kind of content was requested by the source host? Why could this be a problem?
     ```plaintext
     gzip (likely a malware file)
     ```

3. **Close CapME!**.

4. **Navigate to the HTTP dashboard**:
   - Verify the absolute time range includes `2017-01-27 22:54:30.000` to `2017-01-27 22:56:00.000`.

5. **Review the HTTP – Sites section**:
   - Identify which sites are likely part of the exploit campaign.

## Part 2: Investigate the Exploit with Sguil

### Step 1: Open Sguil and locate the alerts
1. **Launch Sguil**:
   - Log in with username `analyst` and password `cyberops`.
   - Enable all sensors and click **Start**.

2. **Locate the group of alerts**:
   - Find the alerts from January 27, 2017.

   **Question**:
   - What are the timestamps for the first and last alerts?
     ```plaintext
     22:54:42 to 22:55:28
     ```

### Step 2: Investigate the alerts in Sguil
1. **Examine the alert details**:
   - Check the **Show Packet Data** and **Show Rule** checkboxes.

2. **Select Alert ID 5.2**:
   - According to the IDS signature rule, which malware family triggered this alert?
     ```plaintext
     PseudoDarkLeech
     ```

3. **Review the Event Messages**:
   - What exploit kit (EK) is involved in this attack?
     ```plaintext
     RIG EK Exploit
     ```
   - Beyond labeling the attack as trojan activity, what other information is provided regarding the type and name of the malware involved?

   - Open `dle_js.js` in a text editor.

   **Questions**:
   - What does the file do?
     ```plaintext
     Writes an iframe to the webpage, redirecting the user to a malicious URI.
     ```
   - How does the code attempt to avoid detection?
     ```plaintext
     By splitting the iframe tag into two pieces.
     ```

## Reflection
Exploit Kits (EKs) are complex and use multiple methods to deliver malware. Understanding their operation requires analyzing multiple steps, including initial infection, payload delivery, and post-infection communication.
