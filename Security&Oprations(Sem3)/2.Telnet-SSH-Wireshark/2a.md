# Examining Telnet and SSH protocols:

---

### **Step 1: Install Required Tools**
#### Install Wireshark
1. Open a terminal.
2. Update your package manager:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
3. Install Wireshark:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install wireshark
   ```
4. During installation, it may ask whether non-superusers can capture packets. Choose "Yes" if you want all users to use Wireshark.
5. Add your user to the Wireshark group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
   ```
6. Restart your terminal or log out and log back in to apply group changes.

#### Install Telnet and SSH Clients/Servers
1. Install Telnet:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install telnetd
   ```
2. Install OpenSSH Server:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openssh-server
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Start Wireshark**
1. Open Wireshark from your applications menu or by typing `wireshark` in the terminal.
2. Select the network interface you’ll use for capturing traffic (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`).
3. Start capturing packets by clicking the **Shark Fin** icon.

### **Step 3: Test Telnet Traffic**
1. **Start Telnet Server:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start inetd
   ```
   Ensure Telnet is running:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tuln | grep 23
   ```
   Port 23 should be listening.

2. **Connect to Telnet Server:**
   Open a new terminal and run:
   ```bash
   telnet localhost
   ```
   Log in with a username and password.

3. **Send Some Data:**
   After logging in, execute simple commands like `ls`, `echo "Hello, Telnet"`, etc.

4. **Stop the Connection:**
   Type `exit` to close the Telnet session.

5. **Stop Wireshark Capture:**
   Go back to Wireshark and stop the capture by clicking the **Red Square** icon.

### **Step 4: Test SSH Traffic**
1. **Start SSH Server:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start ssh
   ```
   Ensure SSH is running:
   ```bash
   sudo netstat -tuln | grep 22
   ```
   Port 22 should be listening.

2. **Connect to SSH Server:**
   Open a new terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ssh localhost
   ```
   Log in with a username and password.

3. **Send Some Data:**
   Execute commands like `ls`, `echo "Hello, SSH"`, etc.

4. **Stop the Connection:**
   Type `exit` to close the SSH session.

5. **Stop Wireshark Capture:**
   Go back to Wireshark and stop the capture.

### **Step 5: Analyze Packets in Wireshark**
1. **Filter Telnet Traffic:**
   - In Wireshark, apply the filter:
     ```plaintext
     telnet
     ```
   - Examine the packets. Telnet traffic is unencrypted, so you can see the commands and responses in plain text.

2. **Filter SSH Traffic:**
   - Apply the filter:
     ```plaintext
     ssh
     ```
   - Examine the packets. SSH traffic is encrypted, so you won’t see the content of the commands or responses.

---

### **Step 6: Save and Export the Capture**
1. Save the capture:
   - Go to **File** > **Save As**.
   - Save it as a `.pcap` file for future analysis.
2. Export specific packets (optional):
   - Select packets you’re interested in, go to **File** > **Export Specified Packets**, and save them.

---

### **Step 7: Cleanup (Optional)**
1. Stop Telnet and SSH services if no longer needed:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop inetd
   sudo systemctl stop ssh
   ```

2. Remove Telnet and SSH (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo apt remove telnetd openssh-server
   ```

---

### **Key Observations**
- **Telnet:** The data is in plain text and can be read directly in Wireshark.
- **SSH:** The data is encrypted, and only packet headers or metadata are visible.
