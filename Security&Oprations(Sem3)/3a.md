# Lab: Snort and Firewall Rules

## Objectives
- **Part 1**: Prepare the Virtual Environment.
- **Part 2**: Analyze Firewall and IDS Logs.
- **Part 3**: Terminate and Clear Mininet Process.

## Background / Scenario
In a secure production network, devices like firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) generate alerts to monitor traffic. Firewalls inspect packet headers, while IDSs often analyze packet payloads. Both use rules to match traffic and take actions such as allowing, dropping, or logging packets.

This lab introduces you to firewall rules and IDS signatures using Snort and iptables in a simulated environment.

### Required Resources
- CyberOps Workstation virtual machine
- Internet connection

## Part 1: Preparing the Virtual Environment

### Step 1: Configure the Virtual Machine
1. **Launch Oracle VirtualBox**:
   - Change the CyberOps Workstation VM's network adapter to **Bridged Mode**:
     - Go to **Machine > Settings > Network**.
     - Under **Attached To**, select **Bridged Adapter** (or **NAT Adapter** if using WiFi with a proxy).
     - Click **OK**.

2. **Start the CyberOps Workstation VM**:
   - Open a terminal and configure its network by running the following script:
     ```bash
     sudo ./lab.support.files/scripts/configure_as_dhcp.sh
     ```
     - Enter the password: `cyberops`.

3. **Verify Network Configuration**:
   - Use the `ifconfig` command to check the VMâ€™s IP address.
   - Test connectivity to the internet by pinging `www.cisco.com`:
     ```bash
     ping www.cisco.com
     ```
     - Press **Ctrl+C** to stop the ping.

## Part 2: Firewall and IDS Logs

### Step 1: Real-Time IDS Log Monitoring
1. **Start Mininet**:
   - In the CyberOps Workstation VM terminal, run the following script to start Mininet:
     ```bash
     sudo ./lab.support.files/scripts/cyberops_extended_topo_no_fw.py
     ```
     - Enter the password: `cyberops`.

2. **Open Shells for Devices**:
   - From the Mininet prompt, open shells for the router (`R1`) and hosts (`H5` and `H10`):
     ```bash
     xterm R1
     xterm H5
     xterm H10
     ```

3. **Start Snort on R1**:
   - In the `R1` shell, start Snort in IDS mode:
     ```bash
     ./lab.support.files/scripts/start_snort.sh
     ```
     - Note: Snort will run in this window without displaying a prompt.

4. **Start the Malware Server on H10**:
   - In the `H10` shell, start the malicious server:
     ```bash
     ./lab.support.files/scripts/mal_server_start.sh
     ```
   - Verify the server is running on port `6666` using `netstat`:
     ```bash
     netstat -tunpa
     ```

5. **Monitor Snort Alerts**:
   - Open another `R1` terminal and monitor the `/var/log/snort/alert` file in real-time:
     ```bash
     tail -f /var/log/snort/alert
     ```

6. **Download Malware on H5**:
   - In the `H5` shell, use `wget` to download a malicious file from the server:
     ```bash
     wget 209.165.202.133:6666/W32.Nimda.Amm.exe
     ```
   - Observe the alert generated in the Snort log.

7. **Capture Traffic with tcpdump**:
   - Start a packet capture on `H5`:
     ```bash
     tcpdump -i H5-eth0 -w nimda.download.pcap &
     ```
   - Re-download the malware file:
     ```bash
     wget 209.165.202.133:6666/W32.Nimda.Amm.exe
     ```
   - Stop the capture by bringing `tcpdump` to the foreground and pressing **Ctrl+C**:
     ```bash
     fg
     ^C
     ```
   - Verify the `.pcap` file was saved:
     ```bash
     ls -l
     ```

---

### Step 2: Tuning Firewall Rules Based on IDS Alerts
1. **List Current iptables Rules**:
   - On `R1`, list the current firewall rules:
     ```bash
     iptables -L -v
     ```

2. **Block Traffic to the Malicious Server**:
   - Add a rule to block traffic to the malicious server on port `6666`:
     ```bash
     iptables -I FORWARD -p tcp -d 209.165.202.133 --dport 6666 -j DROP
     ```

3. **Verify the Rule**:
   - List the updated rules to confirm the new rule was added:
     ```bash
     iptables -L -v
     ```

4. **Test the Block**:
   - Attempt to download the malware file again on `H5`:
     ```bash
     wget 209.165.202.133:6666/W32.Nimda.Amm.exe
     ```
   - The download should fail due to the firewall rule.

## Part 3: Terminate and Clear Mininet Process

1. **Terminate Mininet**:
   - Return to the terminal where Mininet is running and type:
     ```bash
     quit
     ```

2. **Clean Up Mininet Processes**:
   - Run the following command to clean up Mininet processes:
     ```bash
     sudo mn -c
     ```
     - Enter the password: `cyberops`.

## Reflection
Firewalls and IDSs are critical tools for securing networks. By analyzing logs and tuning rules, security analysts can effectively block malicious traffic and protect their networks.
