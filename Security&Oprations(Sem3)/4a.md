### **Step 1: Update and Prepare the Ubuntu System**
1. **Update the System**:
   Ensure your Ubuntu system is up to date.
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Wireshark**:
   Install Wireshark for packet capture and analysis.
   ```bash
   sudo apt install -y wireshark
   ```

3. **Add User to Wireshark Group**:
   Allow your user to run Wireshark without root privileges.
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
   newgrp wireshark
   ```

---

### **Step 2: Capture HTTP Traffic**
1. **Start Wireshark**:
   Launch Wireshark and start capturing packets.
   ```bash
   wireshark &
   ```

2. **Select the Network Interface**:
   - In Wireshark, select the active network interface (e.g., `eth0` or `wlan0`).
   - Click **Start** to begin capturing packets.

3. **Generate HTTP Traffic**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the vulnerable HTTP site:
     ```
     http://www.altoromutual.com:8080/login.jsp
     ```
   - Enter the following credentials:
     - Username: `Admin`
     - Password: `Admin`
   - Click **Login**.

4. **Stop the Capture**:
   After generating HTTP traffic, stop the Wireshark capture by clicking **Stop**.

5. **Analyze HTTP Traffic**:
   - In Wireshark, apply the filter `http` to display only HTTP packets.
   - Look for the **POST** request to `/login.jsp`.
   - Expand the **HTML Form URL Encoded** section to view the credentials (`uid=Admin&passw=Admin`).

### **Step 3: Capture HTTPS Traffic**
1. **Start a New Capture**:
   - In Wireshark, start a new capture on the same network interface.

2. **Generate HTTPS Traffic**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to the non-vulnerable HTTPS site:
     ```
     https://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp
     ```
   - Enter any credentials (e.g., `testuser` and `testpass`).
   - Click **Login**.

3. **Stop the Capture**:
   After generating HTTPS traffic, stop the Wireshark capture by clicking **Stop**.

4. **Analyze HTTPS Traffic**:
   - In Wireshark, apply the filter `tcp.port == 443` to display only HTTPS packets.
   - Look for **Application Data** packets.
   - Expand the **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS)** section to view the encrypted data.

---

### **Step 4: Compare HTTP and HTTPS Traffic**
1. **HTTP Traffic**:
   - Observe that the credentials (`uid=Admin&passw=Admin`) are visible in plaintext.
   - Note the lack of encryption in the HTTP protocol.

2. **HTTPS Traffic**:
   - Observe that the data payload is encrypted under the **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS)** section.
   - Note the use of certificates and encryption in the HTTPS protocol.

---

### **Step 5: Reflection and Cleanup**
1. **Reflection Questions**:
   - What are the advantages of using HTTPS instead of HTTP?
   - Are all websites that use HTTPS considered trustworthy?

2. **Stop Wireshark**:
   Close Wireshark after completing the analysis.

3. **Clean Up**:
   Delete any unnecessary files or captures.

---

### **Summary of Commands**
```bash
# Update and install Wireshark
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y wireshark

# Add user to Wireshark group
sudo usermod -aG wireshark $USER
newgrp wireshark

# Start Wireshark
wireshark &
```

---

### **Expected Output**
- **HTTP Traffic**:
  - Credentials (`uid=Admin&passw=Admin`) are visible in plaintext.
  - No encryption is used.

- **HTTPS Traffic**:
  - Data payload is encrypted under the **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL/TLS)** section.
  - Certificates and encryption are used to secure the data.
