### Lab: Exploring Processes, Threads, Handles, and Windows Registry

---

#### **Objective**
The primary objective of this lab is to gain hands-on experience with processes, threads, handles, and the Windows Registry using tools like Process Explorer from the SysInternals Suite. By the end of this lab, you will be able to:
1. Understand how processes, threads, and handles function in a Windows operating system.
2. Use Process Explorer to analyze active processes, threads, and handles.
3. Explore the Windows Registry and modify specific settings.

#### **Background**
Processes are programs or applications that are currently running on a computer. Each process can have one or more threads, which are units of execution within the process. Handles, on the other hand, are abstract references used by the operating system to manage resources such as files, registry keys, and memory blocks.

The Windows Registry is a hierarchical database that stores configuration settings for the operating system, applications, and user preferences. Understanding how to navigate and modify the registry is crucial for system administrators and cybersecurity professionals.

In this lab, we will use **Process Explorer**, a tool from the SysInternals Suite, to explore processes, threads, and handles. Additionally, we will interact with the Windows Registry to modify a setting related to the End User License Agreement (EULA) for Process Explorer.

#### **Required Resources**
1. A Windows PC with internet access.
2. Administrative privileges on the PC.
3. Access to the SysInternals Suite, specifically **Process Explorer** (`procexp.exe`).

### **Instructions**

### **Part 1: Exploring Processes**

#### **Step 1: Download and Extract the SysInternals Suite**
1. Navigate to the following link to download the SysInternals Suite:
   - [SysInternals Suite Download](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb842062.aspx)
2. Once the download is complete, extract the contents of the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
3. Leave the web browser open for the next steps.

#### **Step 2: Explore an Active Process**
1. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the SysInternals Suite.
2. Open `procexp.exe` (Process Explorer). Accept the **Process Explorer License Agreement** when prompted.
3. The Process Explorer window will display a list of all currently active processes.
4. To locate the web browser process:
   - Drag the **Find Window’s Process** icon (magnifying glass) into the opened web browser window.
   - Identify the process associated with the web browser (e.g., `MicrosoftEdge.exe`).
5. Right-click the identified process and select **Kill Process**. Confirm the action by clicking **OK**.

   **Question:** What happened to the web browser window when the process was killed?  
   **Answer:** The web browser window closed because terminating the process stops its execution.

#### **Step 3: Start Another Process**
1. Open a **Command Prompt**:
   - Press `Win + S`, search for "Command Prompt," and select it.
2. Drag the **Find Window’s Process** icon into the Command Prompt window to locate its process in Process Explorer.
3. Observe that the process for the Command Prompt is `cmd.exe`. Its parent process is `explorer.exe`, and it has a child process called `conhost.exe`.
4. In the Command Prompt, run the following command:
   ```bash
   ping www.google.com
   ```
5. Observe the changes under the `cmd.exe` process in Process Explorer.

   **Question:** What happened during the `ping` process?  
   **Answer:** A child process named `PING.EXE` appeared under `cmd.exe` during the execution of the `ping` command.

6. Right-click the `cmd.exe` process and select **Kill Process**.

   **Question:** What happened to the child process `conhost.exe`?  
   **Answer:** The child process `conhost.exe` terminated because it depends on the parent process (`cmd.exe`). When the parent process stops, all child processes also stop.

### **Part 2: Exploring Threads and Handles**

#### **Step 1: Explore Threads**
1. Open a new Command Prompt.
2. In Process Explorer, right-click the `conhost.exe` process and select **Properties**.
3. Click the **Threads** tab to view the active threads for the `conhost.exe` process.
4. Examine the details of the threads.

   **Question:** What type of information is available in the **Properties** window?  
   **Answer:** Information includes environment variables, security settings, performance metrics, and printable strings.

5. Close the **Properties** window.

#### **Step 2: Explore Handles**
1. In Process Explorer, go to **View > Lower Pane View > Handles** to view the handles associated with the `conhost.exe` process.
2. Examine the handles listed.

   **Question:** What are the handles pointing to?  
   **Answer:** The handles point to files, registry keys, and threads.

3. Close Process Explorer when finished.

### **Part 3: Exploring Windows Registry**

#### **Step 1: Access the Windows Registry**
1. Press `Win + S`, search for "regedit," and select **Registry Editor**.
2. Click **Yes** when prompted to allow the app to make changes.
3. The Registry Editor contains five main hives:
   - **HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT**: Stores application-specific settings like file extension associations.
   - **HKEY_CURRENT_USER**: Contains settings for the currently logged-in user.
   - **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE**: Stores configuration settings for the local computer.
   - **HKEY_USERS**: Contains settings for all users on the local computer.
   - **HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG**: Stores hardware information used at bootup.

#### **Step 2: Modify the EULA Registry Key**
1. Navigate to the following path in the Registry Editor:
   ```
   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Sysinternals\Process Explorer
   ```
2. Locate the key named **EulaAccepted**. Its current value is `0x00000001(1)`, indicating that the EULA has been accepted.
3. Double-click the **EulaAccepted** key and change its value from `1` to `0`. Click **OK**.

   **Question:** What is the value for this registry key in the **Data** column after the change?  
   **Answer:** The value is `0x00000000(0)`.

4. Close the Registry Editor.

#### **Step 3: Verify the Change**
1. Reopen Process Explorer (`procexp.exe`) from the SysInternals Suite folder.
2. Observe what happens when you open the application.

   **Question:** What did you see when you opened Process Explorer?  
   **Answer:** The **Process Explorer License Agreement** dialog box appeared, indicating that the EULA was no longer accepted due to the registry change.

### **Conclusion**
In this lab, you explored processes, threads, and handles using Process Explorer. You also modified a setting in the Windows Registry to observe its impact on application behavior. This exercise provides foundational knowledge for understanding system processes and configurations, which is essential for system administration and cybersecurity tasks.

### **Additional Notes**
- Always back up the Windows Registry before making any changes.
- Be cautious when terminating processes, as killing critical system processes can cause instability or crashes.
