# Lab: Extract an Executable from a PCAP

## Objectives
- **Part 1**: Analyze Pre-Captured Logs and Traffic Captures.
- **Part 2**: Extract Downloaded Files from PCAP.

## Background / Scenario
Understanding network transactions at the packet level is crucial for cybersecurity analysis. In this lab, you will analyze a previously captured `.pcap` file to extract an executable file. This process demonstrates how to retrieve files from network traffic captures for further analysis.

### Required Resources
- CyberOps Workstation virtual machine

## Part 1: Analyze Pre-Captured Logs and Traffic Captures

### Step 1: Navigate to the PCAP Directory
1. **Open a terminal** in the CyberOps Workstation VM:
   ```bash
   cd lab.support.files/pcaps
   ls -l
   ```
   - Confirm the presence of the `nimda.download.pcap` file.

### Step 2: Open the PCAP File in Wireshark
1. **Launch Wireshark** and open the `nimda.download.pcap` file:
   ```bash
   wireshark nimda.download.pcap &
   ```

2. **Locate the HTTP GET Request**:
   - Select the **fourth packet** in the capture.
   - Expand the **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** section to view the details.

   **Question**:
   - What type of request is shown in the fourth packet?
     ```plaintext
     HTTP GET request
     ```

3. **Rebuild the TCP Flow**:
   - Right-click the first TCP packet (SYN packet) and select **Follow > TCP Stream**.

   **Questions**:
   - What do the symbols in the **Follow TCP Stream** window represent?
     ```plaintext
     The symbols are the binary contents of the downloaded file. Wireshark attempts to decode it as text, resulting in unreadable symbols.
     ```
   - Why are there readable words among the symbols?
     ```plaintext
     These are strings embedded in the executable code, often used for messages or debugging purposes.
     ```

   **Challenge Question**:
   - What is the actual executable file being downloaded?
     ```plaintext
     Microsoft Windows cmd.exe
     ```

4. **Close the Follow TCP Stream Window** to return to the main Wireshark interface.

## Part 2: Extract Downloaded Files from PCAP

### Step 1: Identify the File in the Capture
1. **Select the GET Request Packet**:
   - Locate the packet where the HTTP GET request was made (e.g., from `209.165.200.235` to `209.165.202.133`).

2. **Export the File**:
   - Go to **File > Export Objects > HTTP**.
   - In the HTTP object list window, select the `W32.Nimda.Amm.exe` file and click **Save As**.
   - Save the file to the `/home/analyst` directory.

### Step 2: Verify the Extracted File
1. **Return to the Terminal**:
   - Navigate to the `/home/analyst` directory and list the files:
     ```bash
     cd /home/analyst
     ls -l
     ```
   - Confirm that `W32.Nimda.Amm.exe` is present.

2. **Identify the File Type**:
   - Use the `file` command to determine the file type:
     ```bash
     file W32.Nimda.Amm.exe
     ```
   - Output:
     ```plaintext
     PE32+ executable (console) x86-64, for MS Windows
     ```

   **Question**:
   - What would be the next step in analyzing this file?
     ```plaintext
     Execute the file in a controlled, sandboxed environment to observe its behavior. Alternatively, upload it to an online malware analysis tool like VirusTotal for further inspection.
     ```

## Reflection
This lab demonstrates how to extract files from network traffic captures using tools like Wireshark. By analyzing `.pcap` files, security analysts can reconstruct network events and retrieve malicious files for further investigation.
