# Practical Guide: Encrypting and Decrypting Data Using a Hacker Tool

This guide will walk you through the steps to create, encrypt, and decrypt files using a hacker tool (`fcrackzip`). Follow the steps carefully.

---

## Prerequisites
1. A Linux-based operating system (SecurityOps).
2. Basic knowledge of terminal commands.
3. Install `fcrackzip` (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install fcrackzip
   ```

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Create a Directory and Navigate into It
1. Open your terminal.
2. Create a directory named `first`:
   ```bash
   mkdir first
   ```
3. Navigate into the `first` directory:
   ```bash
   cd first
   ```

---

### Step 2: Create Sample Text Files
1. Create three sample text files (`sample1.txt`, `sample2.txt`, `sample3.txt`) with some content:
   ```bash
   echo "this is my first practicle1" > sample1.txt
   echo "this is my first practicle2" > sample2.txt
   echo "this is my first practicle3" > sample3.txt
   ```

---

### Step 3: Encrypt the Files into a ZIP Archive
1. Create an encrypted ZIP file (`file1.zip`) with the sample files:
   ```bash
   zip -e file1.zip sample*
   ```
   - When prompted, set the password as `g`.

2. Create another encrypted ZIP file (`file2.zip`) with the same sample files:
   ```bash
   zip -e file2.zip sample*
   ```
   - When prompted, set the password as `w1`.

---

### Step 4: Unzip the Encrypted Archive
1. Unzip `file1.zip` to verify the encryption:
   ```bash
   unzip file1.zip
   ```
   - Enter the password `g` when prompted.

---

### Step 5: Use `fcrackzip` to Crack the ZIP Passwords
1. Check the help menu of `fcrackzip` to understand its usage:
   ```bash
   fcrackzip --help
   ```

2. Attempt to crack the password for `file1.zip`:
   ```bash
   fcrackzip -vul 1-2 file1.zip
   ```
   - `-v`: Verbose mode.
   - `-u`: Try to unzip the file after cracking.
   - `-l 1-2`: Password length between 1 and 2 characters.

3. Attempt to crack the password for `file2.zip`:
   ```bash
   fcrackzip -vul 1-2 file2.zip
   ```

---

## Expected Results
- `file1.zip` should be cracked with the password `g`.
- `file2.zip` should be cracked with the password `w1`.
