# Practical Guide: Encrypting and Decrypting Data Using OpenSSL

This guide will walk you through the steps to install the required tools, create, encrypt, and decrypt files using OpenSSL. Follow the steps carefully.

---

## Prerequisites
1. A Linux-based operating system (SecurityOps).
2. Basic knowledge of terminal commands.

---

## Step 1: Install Required Tools
1. Update your system's package list:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install OpenSSL (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openssl
   ```
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   openssl version
   ```

---

## Step 2: Create a Sample Text File
1. Open your terminal.
2. Create a text file named `text1.txt` with the content "hello world":
   ```bash
   echo "hello world" > text1.txt
   ```

---

## Step 3: Encrypt the File Using OpenSSL
1. Encrypt `text1.txt` using AES-256-CBC encryption and save the output to `text2.txt`:
   ```bash
   openssl aes-256-cbc -a -in text1.txt -out text2.txt
   ```
   - You will be prompted to enter and confirm a password. Remember this password for decryption.
2. View the encrypted content of `text2.txt`:
   ```bash
   cat text2.txt
   ```

---

## Step 4: Decrypt the File Using OpenSSL
1. Decrypt `text2.txt` and save the output to `text3.txt`:
   ```bash
   openssl aes-256-cbc -a -d -in text2.txt -out text3.txt
   ```
   - Enter the password you used during encryption.
2. View the decrypted content of `text3.txt`:
   ```bash
   cat text3.txt
   ```

   Alternatively, you can decrypt and display the content directly without saving to a file:
   ```bash
   openssl aes-256-cbc -a -d -in text2.txt
   ```

---

## Step 5: Create and Encrypt a Custom Text File
1. Create a custom text file named `letter_to_grandma.txt`:
   ```bash
   nano letter_to_grandma.txt
   ```
   - Add the following content to the file:
     ```
     Hi Grandma,
     I am writing this letter to thank you for the chocolate chip cookies you sent me. I got them this morning and I have already eaten half of the box! They are absolutely delicious!

     I wish you all the best. Love,
     Your cookie-eater grandchild.
     ```
   - Save and exit the editor (`Ctrl + O`, then `Ctrl + X`).

2. Encrypt `letter_to_grandma.txt` and save the output to `msg.enc`:
   ```bash
   openssl aes-256-cbc -a -in letter_to_grandma.txt -out msg.enc
   ```
   - Set a password when prompted.

---

## Step 6: Decrypt the Custom Encrypted File
1. Decrypt `msg.enc` and save the output to `text4.txt`:
   ```bash
   openssl aes-256-cbc -a -d -in msg.enc -out text4.txt
   ```
   - Enter the password you used during encryption.
2. View the decrypted content of `text4.txt`:
   ```bash
   cat text4.txt
   ```

---

## Expected Results
- The content of `text1.txt` and `text3.txt` should match after encryption and decryption.
- The content of `letter_to_grandma.txt` and `text4.txt` should match after encryption and decryption.

---

## Notes
- Ensure you remember the passwords used for encryption, as they are required for decryption.
- This practical is for educational purposes only. Do not use these tools for malicious purposes.
