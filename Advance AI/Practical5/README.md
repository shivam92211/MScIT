Here is a `README.md` file that explains the setup and usage for your object detection script:

# YOLOv5 Object Detection with Custom Model

This project demonstrates how to use the YOLOv5 model for object detection on a custom image. It loads the model either from a local file or automatically downloads it if not present, performs object detection on an image, and saves the annotated image with bounding boxes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- `ultralytics` for YOLOv5 model handling
- `opencv-python` for image loading and saving
- `matplotlib` for displaying the image

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Project Structure

```
.
├── dogs.jpeg               # Input image file for object detection
├── main.py                 # Main Python script
└── README.md               # This readme file
```

## Setup

### Step 1: Prepare the Image
Place the image you want to run object detection on (e.g., `dogs.jpeg`) in the same directory as the `main.py` script. You can replace the `image_path` in the script with the path to your image.

### Step 2: Download or Load the YOLOv5 Model
The script checks if the `yolov5s.pt` model file is present locally. If it doesn't find it, it will automatically download the model weights from the internet.

### Step 3: Run the Object Detection Script

Run the `main.py` script to perform object detection. You can execute the script using:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Script Breakdown:

- **Model Loading**: The model is loaded from a local file (`yolov5s.pt`) if it exists. If not, it will be downloaded automatically.
- **Image Reading**: The script reads the image file specified by `image_path`.
- **Object Detection**: The YOLOv5 model performs object detection on the image.
- **Results**: The annotated image with bounding boxes is displayed and saved as `annotated_image.jpg`.

### Step 4: Output

Once the script completes, it will display the annotated image and save it as `annotated_image.jpg` in the same directory. You will see a message indicating the path where the annotated image has been saved.

```bash
Annotated image saved to annotated_image.jpg
```

## Example

For the example image `dogs.jpeg`, the model will detect objects (such as dogs, humans, etc.) and annotate them with bounding boxes.

## Notes

- Ensure that the image you use contains objects that YOLOv5 can recognize (e.g., people, animals, vehicles).
- The script saves the output as `annotated_image.jpg` in the current working directory.
- You can modify the `model_path` variable to load different YOLO models if required.
